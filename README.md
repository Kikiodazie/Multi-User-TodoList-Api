### About

This is a mini project practicing on building secured API's with Spring Boot and JWT. The idea was to 
build a Todo-List API that performs CRUD operations, and can be consumed by a frontend/mobile app.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Web**, **Spring Security**, **Spring Data JPA** and **Docker**. 
A postgres Database linked to the app image with docker-compose and deployed on docker-hub.

An API Documentation, created/updated using **Swagger**. Visit   ``http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`` when running locally to view API docs.
